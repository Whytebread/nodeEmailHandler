These steps will help you configure and run this mail server. 

- Copy all this code into a project folder in VS Code and/or a repository on GitHub, and connect it to render.com 
- Node setup:
  - Do NOT type npm init -y (already have a package.json)
  - Instead, type "npm install" (this will install the dependencies listed in package.json, including nodemailer)
- When ready (see below first!) type "node server.js" (to start it up)

Configuring the code: 
- Nodemailer credentials: 
  - In the sendMail function in server.js: 
    - Under "auth:" set "user:" and "pass:" (this is where your gmail email address and password go) 
- Destination Email: 
  - Look for: "let mailOptions = {"
    - from: (change to whatever you want the user to see as the "from" address)
    - to: (set to the destination email -- this is the company employee who will handle the incoming form data)

Notes: 
- You do NOT make an account with Nodemailer
- Nodemailer just uses an existing mail service (your account) 
- This project is set up to use a gmail account
- This requires you to put your password in the server.js code. This is why you want to make a new gmail account for this, because you'll be putting your email address and password into a public repository on GitHub!
